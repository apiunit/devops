+ Is Automating Processes for Onboarding and Offboarding the Best Solution?

+ Create a Common Language Within Your Organization

+ Organisation Description Language

Sposoby na optymaliazacje poprzez standaryzacje i specjalizacje


To solve all the issues above, organizations need to integrate all the separate systems that govern the identity lifecycle of a user and automate user access. Starting with connecting the HR system, which is the source of truth for when employees join, leave or move, to all the applications and permissions granted to users in the organization. In many cases this includes an overlay over old systems like Active Directory. An end to end automation of onboarding and offboarding processes can benefit not just the IT department, but also the business and the end-users.

All business consultants agree that clear communication within an organization is one of the keys to success. Managers need effective organizational communication to interact with staff and give understandable instructions. Staff members need to understand terminology and concepts to properly communicate with customers and clients. Effective communication is so critical to the efficient functioning of an organization and satisfaction of employees that it has been called the building block of an organization.

Every business organization has its own language: Doctors, lawyers, plumbers and others all have specific terminology unique to their profession. For example, doctors have patients, lawyers have clients, and plumbers have customers. They use these and other not-so-common terms that are specific to their industry to create understanding and a sense of community within their individual organizational structures.
Benefits of creating a common language

    A common language assures that all members of the organization understand expectations. Misunderstandings are minimized so time formerly spent on correcting errors can be spent on productivity.
    Customers, clients, or patients hear consistency throughout the organization, which gives them a sense that there is cohesiveness and reliability and enhances the image of the organization.
    Employees and staff gain a sense of identity and belonging to a community.
    The common language provides a sort of shorthand among the organization’s community of management and staff.
    When management and staff speak the same language, there is a feeling of camaraderie and relationships between them are stronger.
    A common language creates a sense of culture for those working within the organization, which is a major factor in its success.

How an employee survey assists

Developing a common language is not as easy as it seems. Words and phrases unique to the organization need to be identified and their meaning and usage defined. The new words and phrases need to be used appropriately in all company communications and documents.

Employees need to be a part of the process for the transition and implementation of a common language to be effective. This can be accomplished with employee experience surveys. Surveys can determine:

    The views and sentiments of the employees regarding a common language
    Any misconceptions concerning language and terminology
    Terms that need to be defined according to those who are being surveyed

An analysis of the survey results will identify areas of organizational communication that need to be improved and standardized.

Best practices for offboarding start with onboarding

Offboarding is part of a company’s broader IT security and HR management policies. Best practices include the following:

—Establish a security and compliance group within the company. This group should monitor two key areas: 1) who has access to which IT services and 2) how information is being accessed and shared.

—Put in place a clear set of company IT policies. This includes policies on application usage, a list of approved sites and services and a list of approved software and applications that employees can use.

—Provide role-based access to applications. Maintain an approval process for all services, applications, and equipment that employees need. Keep records in a centralized database, so you know what each employee was given.

—Create a central repository for administrative logins and passwords. Don’t give users administrative rights to their laptops.

—Eliminate shared logins/accounts. Assign each account to one person whenever possible.

—Conduct regular audits of user accounts (LDAP, Active Directory®, and all applications). Track all of the applications being used, so you know who “owns” them and what access and control IT has.

—Set up accounts in a central location, such as Active Directory in Windows® environments, and make sure all cloud applications are SAML authenticated. This makes it easier to manage and de-provision employee accounts.

—Use unique identifiers when creating new employee accounts. This way, if a user has different name listings (e.g. J. Smith, Joe S., etc.), it’s easier to find all of the applications with which he or she is associated.



Adhere to a strict employee offboarding checklist

When someone leaves, make sure IT conducts their own exit interview and performs appropriate offboarding tasks, including collecting all company assets (laptops, phones, ID badges, etc.). IT should also:

—Maintain distribution list for terminations. Similar to a new hire distribution list, create a list that informs key departments (Finance, HR, Facilities, Legal, etc.) when an employee is leaving. Someone also should be responsible for informing appropriate external stakeholders (e.g. customers and suppliers) of the employee’s departure and designated replacement.

—Disable logins to all employee accounts. It is critical to terminate every employee account to every service, both on-premises and in the cloud. If a single sign-on solution is issued, review applications saved in the employee’s portal to discover if any applications have been used without IT’s knowledge. If a mobile device management solution is used, remote wipe company applications on the employee’s mobile device.

—Direct the email and phone accounts of a departing employee to his/her manager. This can be done by forwarding or giving the manager login access. Wait a set amount of time (e.g. 30 days) and then archive and delete the accounts.

—Check if the employee is the primary contact for an online account or project and make sure that contact gets re-assigned.
